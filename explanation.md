<h1>How does a browser work...?</h1>

A browser is a software application that runs on Internet-connected devices. It allows you to view Web pages, as well as use other content and technologies among them files, video, digital certificates, flashes and digital certificates in ordered layout. The main components of a browser are:
 User interface– It is the space where interaction between users and the browser occurs.
Browser Engine– It is the piece of code that communicates the inputs of the user interface with the rendering engine.
Rendering Engine -It is the part thoroughly responsible for displaying the requested content on the screen.
Networking – The fraction of the code written in the browser, responsible for sending various network calls.
JavaScript Interpreter – It is the component of the browser written to interpret the javascript code presented in a web page. 
UI Backend – This draws basic widgets on the browser like combo boxes, windows, etc.
 Data Storage – It is a small database created on the local drive of the computer where the browser is installed. This database stores various files like cache, cookies, etc.
Browsers usually use Hypertext Transfer Protocol to display web pages (HTTP).HTTP determines actions that should be executed by browsers and web servers in response to commands. This is the main protocol in the Web that allows web clients and web servers to be able to communicate.
The browser breaks the web address into three parts.
1.    The Protocol: HTTP
2.    The server name:www.moringaschool.com
3.    The file name follows the server name.
When you enter a Web address (URL) in the browser, it sends an https command to web server directing it to fetch and transmit web page requested and consequently display information.
 
For a browser to connect to the web server, it sends data to name server requesting the server name to be translated to IP address. When this is done the browser can now be connected to the internet at resolved IP address on port 80.
